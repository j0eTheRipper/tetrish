She drank coffee
I played Minecraft
I drank rain
Bugs were bright
Waves are vicious
Whales dive deep
Eagles fly afar
He stamps passports
Spiders hide plainly
Dolphins left sea
Tanks shoot afar
Trucks are hazardous
I smelled ice-cream
He dropped dead
Ants stormed in
Ants took over
Ants built colonies
Giants crushed them
Storms rage menacingly
Storms hail vigorously
Panthers wait quielty
Panthers are fast
Panthers feast pridely
