Rain came down
Rain brought peace
Chants were heard
Screams echoed everywhere
He stood trial
He backed down
He lagged behind
Johnny made deals
Johnny kept quiet
Johnny had ideas
They ran silently
Computers ran silently
Phones ran silently 
Order was enforced
Order was restored
Order was lost
Conan solved mysteries
Conan ate candy
Conan became shorter
Bodies disappeared overnight
Bananas rot quickly
Trucks carry packages
Doom was nearby
Cthulhu was close
