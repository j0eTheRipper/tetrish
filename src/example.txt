Death is waiting
Youssef ate sandwiches
Obama was elected
Obama thought hard
Obama had decided
Siddig is online
Siddiq was hungry
Zeyad studied hard
Zeyad researched extensively
Zeyad practiced hard
He craved ice-cream
You saw darkness
Omar is coming
Walter cooked fast
Jesse woke up
Something was off
This is fishy
This is strange
We had disagreements
Trees are beautiful
Life is short
I studied well
Mohammad was quick
Mohammad had mishaps
The sun rose
I ordered burgers
We survived again
Trees fell down
They kept feasting
He smelled awful
We were asleep
I seized it
The chance came
The water poured
Canals filled up
Tribes caught fish
The market smelled
I ate pizza
I smelled pizza
He smelled fish
She drank coffee
I played Minecraft
I drank rain
There was light
The ocean waved
The whale dove
The pigeon flew
My eyelids closed
The beasts hid
The beasts left
The beasts grieved
The truck arrived
I smelled ice-cream
The ice-cream fell
Ants stormed in
Ants took over
Ants built colonies
Giants crushed them
The storm raged
The storm stopped
The panther waited
The panther pounced
The panther feasted
Rain came down
Rain brought peace
Chants were heard
Screams echoed everywhere
He stood trial
He backed down
He lagged behind
Johnny made deals
Johnny kept quiet
Johnny had ideas
They ran silently
Computers ran silently
Phones ran silently 
Order was enforced
Order was restored
Order was lost
Conan solved mysteries
Conan ate candy
Conan became shorter
The bodies disappeared
The food disappeared
The truck disappeared
Doom was near
Cthulhu was close
The ground shook
We shook hands
I looked around
The team disbanded
We came late
