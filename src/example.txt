Obama was elected
Obama thought hard
Obama had decided
Siddig is online
Siddig was hungry
Zeyad studied hard
Zeyad researched extensively
Zeyad practiced hard
He craved ice-cream
You saw darkness
Omar is afraid
Walter cooked fast
Jesse woke up
Something was off
This is fishy
This is strange
We had disagreements
Trees are beautiful
Life is short
I studied well
Mohammad was quick
Mohammad had mishaps
Osama is sick
I ordered burgers
We survived again
Trees fell down
They are awake
He smelled awful
We were asleep
I seized it
Buildings were built
She poured water
Canals filled up
Tribes caught fish
Markets smell bad
I ate pizza
I smelled pizza
He smelled fish
She drank coffee
I played Minecraft
I drank rain
Bugs were bright
Waves are vicious
Whales dive deep
Eagles fly afar
He stamps passports
Spiders hide plainly
Dolphins left sea
Tanks shoot afar
Trucks are hazardous
I smelled ice-cream
He dropped dead
Ants stormed in
Ants took over
Ants built colonies
Giants crushed them
Storms rage menacingly
Storms hail vigorously
Panthers wait quielty
Panthers are fast
Panthers feast pridely
Rain came down
Rain brought peace
Chants were heard
Screams echoed everywhere
He stood trial
He backed down
He lagged behind
Johnny made deals
Johnny kept quiet
Johnny had ideas
They ran silently
Computers ran silently
Phones ran silently 
Order was enforced
Order was restored
Order was lost
Conan solved mysteries
Conan ate candy
Conan became shorter
Bodies disappeared overnight
Bananas rot quickly
Trucks carry packages
Doom was nearby
Cthulhu was close
The ground shook
We shook hands
I looked around
He taught classes
We came late
NASA made discoveries
Feather falls slow
Time is relative
Scientists study animals
He fed kittens
Tsunamis flood ports
Heat is crucial
Engineers made designs
Space is vast
Gravity is mysterious
Radiation is dangerous
