# Tetrish
##### Tetris with a kink

## last updates:
We’re midway through! The blocks now move like good old tetris, they jump from left to right, and they appear in randomized order. All that’s left: inscribe words, make the blocks disappear, and make some design.

Here are the milestones and what we’ve reached so far:

- [x] Create a window and render the graphics
- [x] Add different block colors to the game.
- [x] Randomize the order of the blocks appearing (so that the next block-sequence won't be predictable by the user)
- [x] Enable the user to control the blocks’ position
- [x] Have the blocks jump from left to right upon user’s click on the arrow key, not move smoothly (This is to imitate the behavior of a tetris game)
- [ ] Inscribing the different parts of speech on each block
- [ ] Inscribing the Islamic rules on each block (in order to satisfy the 2-subjects requirement).
- [ ] Add a scoreboard, a starting screen, an end game screen, and a good-bye screen.
